I got a test task from Xored https://docs.xored.com/display/XL/Xored+home+work+test+task
To implement/develop Eclipse Plugin(s) adding this new type of launch-configuration.

I started to learn http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipsePlugin/article.html and downloaded Eclipse SDK, tried to make simple plugin, using PDE pattern, and push it into github. And the link https://habrahabr.ru/post/243297/ was very useful.

I also noted the link https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/ru/library/os-eclipse-plugindev1/
