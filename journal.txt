I got a test task from Xored https://docs.xored.com/display/XL/Xored+home+work+test+task
Briefly: to implement/develop Eclipse Plugin(s) adding new type of launch-configuration.

I'm starting to learn http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipsePlugin/article.html and download Eclipse SDK, try to make simple plugin, using PDE pattern, and push it into github. And the link https://habrahabr.ru/post/243297/ is very useful.

I also note the link https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/ru/library/os-eclipse-plugindev1/

What is the launch configuration?
I have to read http://wiki.eclipse.org/FAQ_What_is_a_launch_configuration%3F
How to make it? I have to read http://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-Launch-Framework/launch.html

I continue reading article about launch configuration.
And explore directory ...\workspace\ which contains xml launch files in directory
...\workspace\.metadata\.plugins\org.eclipse.debug.core\.launches
I try to get Eclipse workspace path (http://exploreeclipse.blogspot.ru/2014/01/getting-eclipse-workspace-file-system.html) but I fail...
I have to continue to study this.
