I got a test task from Xored https://docs.xored.com/display/XL/Xored+home+work+test+task
Briefly: to implement/develop Eclipse Plugin(s) adding new type of launch-configuration.

I'm starting to learn http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipsePlugin/article.html and download Eclipse SDK, try to make simple plugin, using PDE pattern, and push it into github. And the link https://habrahabr.ru/post/243297/ is very useful.

I also note the link https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/ru/library/os-eclipse-plugindev1/

Yesterday I made new plug-in project in Eclipse (EclipseCompositeLaunch)
and found out how to create new type of configuration. I added 2 plug-ins in manifest.mf (org.eclipse.debug.core, org.eclipse.debug.ui) and edited only plugin.xml, added 3 extention.

Today I added new package compositelaunch.ui and class CompositeTabGroup, inheriting it from AbstractLaunchConfigurationTabGroup. I still use only common tab (CommonTab()).
